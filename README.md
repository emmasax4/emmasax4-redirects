# emmasax4-redirects

This repository is designed to be temporary to assist in creating solid 301 redirects from the following domains to `https://emmasax4.com`.

* `http://emmasax4.info`
* `https://emmasax4.info`
* `http://www.emmasax4.info`
* `https://www.emmasax4.info` (ideally, however this one actually doesn't work because there is no SSL certificate for `www.emmasax4.info`, ðŸ˜­)

This repository has created a single file called `index.html`. This is the landing page when somebody navigates to `emmasax4.info`. Then, it loads the CSS, Bootstrap, fonts, and images from the primary site (I just copy-pasted them... nothing fancier) so that it has the proper "feel" of the original site and therefore looks authentic. The page has a nice message that the site has moved (so users know what happened), and has a button to redirect. Else, there's also a timed redirect that will redirect automatically after five seconds.

The redirects are unique because they persist the path of the URL. So, if a user navigates to `https://emmasax4.info/path/to/page/`, then they'll be redirected to `https://emmasax4.com/path/to/page/`. To make this work, I created a symlinked file as well: `404.html`.

When a user navigates to any page at `https://emmasax4.info/` that is _not_ the base URL (so there's any path after the first `/`), then they'll be brought to the 404 page (since my static site doesn't have any other pages). And I want the 404 page to have the _exact same_ look and functionality as the primary page, hence why I created a symlink.

```bash
ln -s index.html 404.html
```

I didn't bother filling the "project" with anything more than necessary, which is why the majority of this repository is so empty.

My plan from here on out is to keep this repository and the old domain (`emmasax4.info`) alive for about six months while my SEO ratings come back. And then, I can sunset this repository and just put in plain `http` redirects in my domain name registrar going forward.

Huge thanks to Oleksii Tsvietnov for [the idea](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/permanently-redirect-github-pages).
